# seat-industry

Industry planner for SeAT. 

Originally based on [recursivetree/seat-alliance-industry](https://github.com/eveseat-plugins/seat-alliance-industry) industry project, this evolved as
a fork and then became it's own thing through major refactoring and modification on how the orders and deliveries works.

## Installation
See the instruction over at the [seat documentation](https://eveseat.github.io/docs/community_packages/).

The package name is `hermesdj/seat-industry`.
